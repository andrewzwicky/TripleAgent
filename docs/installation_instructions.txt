Here are the steps to utilize Triple Agent data
to create reports & query data on your own.

1. Python 3.7: 
    - 3.8 (latest) will likely work, but I havenâ€™t tested it.
    - https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Clone Triple Agent Repository
    - Triple Agent is hosted on Github.
    - To get the code, the best option is to clone the repository.
    - This allows you to easily receive future updates.
    - Repo: https://github.com/andrewzwicky/TripleAgent
    - I use Github Desktop, this is the simplest way to clone Github repositories.

3. Install Dependencies
    - Triple Agent uses a few third party libraries to produce the pretty plots.
    - These are installed using 'pip' (Python Package Installer).
    - First, navigate to the cloned Triple Agent folder.
    - Then type `powershell` in the address bar.
    - In PowerShell prompt, type `pip install .[plot]` to install the dependencies.
